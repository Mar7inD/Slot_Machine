Slot Machine

About:
I decided to create this problem so I could challenge myself, because I was not familiar how the pictures could be made to move like on a real one. The solution that I reached was very satisfying. 

Features:
In the program you can add money, choose amount to play with and you decide when to start and stop the machine so the only one that is controlling the slot machine is you. On the bottom it is written what amount of money you are winning depending on the number of matches you have. 

How to use:
To start the program you should download and open the project. Then you enter again SlotMachine after which you choose bin and Debug. Finally you are in the direction of the SlotMachine.exe file which you should run and you have now launched the program. There is a picture of the program when it is launched.

Technologies:
This program is based 100% on C# and the .NET framework.
